# Sparse Array/Game of Life

Sparse 2D matrix that only stores non-zero values, in such a way that iterating through the rows or columns of non-empty elements is relatively fast.

On top of it, "The Game of Life" is a cellular automation, consisting of this sparse matrix; each cell is either alive or dead; the game is "played" in generations with a set of rules.
